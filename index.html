                    Hello, my name is Jonas, I have been sculpting off and on for twelve years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was always intimidated by sculpting because I thought that only water-based clay was available, requiring a kiln to fire.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Then I watched a TED talk by Adam Savage (from MythBusters) In it he talks about his creative process and what gets it going.
                    The thing that triggered it this time was the fact that no complete dodo skeleton exists where 100% of it is from the same individual.
                    So he decided to sculpt a life-size dodo skeleton (he had never sculpted before) out of something called "Super Sculpey" a type of clay that can be "fired" in a regular kitchen oven to become like plastic.
